## Introduction

PRIDE Affinity Proteomics (PRIDE-AP) is a new archive within the Proteomics IDEntification database (PRIDE) dedicated to advance the field of affinity proteomics (AP) by providing a centralised hub for openly accessible datasets generated using the innovative AP platforms such as Olink and SomaScan. We aim to foster collaboration, accelerate research, and promote the widespread dissemination of high-quality affinity proteomics data. This document outlines the submission guidelines for PRIDE-AP. PRIDE Archive infrastructure will be used to support the submission, validation and dissemination of AP datasets. 

>[!NOTE]
>Some parts of this document will reference and link to existing guidelines in PRIDE.

## PRIDE Archive guidelines and policies

Before reading specific guidelines about affinity proteomics dataset submissions in PRIDE-AP, we recommend you to read about the following topics:

-   [Introduction to PRIDE Archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/markdownpage/intropride).
-   [PRIDE Archive data policy](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/markdownpage/datapolicy).
-   [PRIDE documentation pages: uploading, searching and visualization](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/markdownpage/documentationpage).

## Supported technologies

As of this writing, the PRIDE-AP Archive explicitly supports Olink Explore, Olink Target, and SomaScan datasets. Future AP approaches from the same or other vendors must be formally agreed upon and explicitly supported before inclusion in PRIDE-AP.

## Dataset structure and file requirements

### Accession

All PRIDE-AP datasets get a unique accession PAD (**P**roteomics **A**ffinity **D**ataset) identifier (PAD + a six-figure integer, for example, PAD000001), which is the one that should be cited and highlighted in the scientific literature, both by the original data producers and by third parties (in case of data reuse). This accession is a unique identifier released only by the PRIDE database (please read the [section about ProteomeXchange below](#support-for-ap-experiments-in-proteomexchange)).

### Dataset metadata

For every dataset, a minimum metadata is required similar to ProteomeXchange dataset requirements. The following information must be provided for each dataset: 
- Title (free-text) 
- Description (free-text)
- Sample analysis protocol (free-text) 
- Data analysis protocol (free-text) 
- Data submitter (name, affiliation, e-mail address)
- Principal Investigator (name, affiliation, e-mail address)
- Species (ontology or controlled vocabulary (CV) term) 
- Tissue (ontology/CV term) 
- List using ontology/CV terms of Instrument, Species, Tissue, Software 
- Quantification method (ontology/ CV term).

### File requirements

PRIDE-AP, like ProteomeXchange, organizes dataset files into three main categories:

- **Raw**: These files contain the original data generated by the technology, such as raw sequencing reads or signal intensities. They are essential for data processing and analysis. In affinity proteomics, "Raw" files differ from MS technologies, where they represent MS signals. Instead, they can include various file types such as FASTQ files or non-normalized protein expression matrices.
- **Results**: These files include protein expression matrices and other data derived from processing the raw data. They are intended for downstream analysis, visualization, and interpretation (e.g., NPX files from Olink).
- **Additional**: This category encompasses any supplementary data that does not fit into the previous two, such as quality control (QC) reports.

The following sections outline the specific requirements and file types for each technology.

### Olink technologies: 

#### Olink Explore series

Olink Explore is Olink's advanced platform for high-throughput protein biomarker discovery, combining their proprietary Proximity Extension Assay (PEA) technology with Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) as the readout method. This platform is designed to enable large-scale proteomics studies with high sensitivity, specificity, and scalability.

##### Olink NGS-based data submissions

>[!IMPORTANT]
>NPX and Raw files are mandatory for each submission to ensure comprehensive and reproducible datasets. To minimize confusion and maintain consistency in categorizing Additional, Raw, and Results files, we strongly recommend adhering to the following naming conventions:
> 1. NPX files: Use the format 'file_name.npx.csv' for normalized protein expression files (e.g., NPX files). This ensures clarity in identifying processed data ready for downstream analysis.
> 2. Raw files: Use the format 'file_name.raw.csv' for files containing unprocessed, original data, such as raw sequencing reads or non-normalized protein expression matrices. This helps distinguish foundational data essential for reanalysis or alternative processing.
>If your submission includes generic file extensions like .xlsx, .parquet, or .csv, it is crucial to maintain the same naming convention by appending .npx, .raw before the extension. This practice ensures clarity across diverse file formats and facilitates easy identification and categorization of files.

If your experiment is done on the latest version of Olink Explore (@TODO: question for Eva) then you must provide **.parquet file** exported from Olink Explore which includes the sample metadata, protein intensities, and NPX absolute quantification values. If the experiment is done on an older version of Olink Explore, then you can provide a **.csv file** 

By following these guidelines, submissions will adhere to a standardized structure, promoting transparency, usability, and consistency across datasets.

##### Raw File and Result validations for Olink Explore

### File Validation Rules for PRIDE Submission  

During the submission process, the PRIDE submission tool performs a validation step to ensure the structure and content of each file type meet specific requirements. Below are the validation rules for each file type:  

- **NPX (Normalized Protein Expression) files**: Main outputs of Olink Explore and are used for downstream protein expression analysis. These files provide processed and normalized data for consistency across samples and proteins. The following columns **MUST** be included:  

```
- Sample Information: 
  - `Sample ID`, `Sample Plate`, `Sample Well`, `Group/Condition`  
- Protein Information: 
  - `Protein ID`, `Protein Name`, `Olink Panel`, `LOD`  
- NPX Values: 
  - `NPX Value`, `Below LOD`  
- Control Information: 
  - `Control Type`, `Control NPX`  
```

- **Raw CSV File**: Raw data files from Olink Explore contain essential experimental information, such as signal intensities, sample identifiers, and assay metadata. While the structure may vary depending on the platform version and software, the following columns **MUST** be included:  

```
- Sample Information: 
  - `Sample ID`, `Sample Plate`, `Sample Well`  
- Protein Information: 
  - `Protein ID`, `Protein Name`  
- Signal Data: 
  - `Raw Signal`, `Background Signal`, `Normalized Signal`  
- Quality Control (QC) Metrics: 
  - `LOD (Limit of Detection)`, `QC Flag`, `Replicate Consistency`  
- Control Information: 
  - `Control Type`, `Control ID`  
- Assay Metadata: 
  - `Olink Panel`, `Assay Type`, `Assay Batch`, `Assay Plate`  
- Additional Experimental Details: 
  - `Dilution Factor`, `Processing Date`, `Operator`  
```

- **Raw Parquet File**: The last Olink Explore version exports the raw data in a Parquet file format. The following columns **MUST** be included:  

```  
- Mandatory String Columns: 
  - `SampleID`, `SampleType`, `WellID`, `PlateID`, `DataAnalysisRefID`, `OlinkID`, `UniProt`, `Panel`, `Block`, `Normalization`, `SampleQC`, `ExploreVersion`  
- Mandatory Integer Column: 
  - `Count`  
- Mandatory Double Columns:
  - `ExtNPX`, `NPX`  
- String Column Validation: 
  - The `SampleQC` column must have one of the following values: `NA`, `PASS`, `WARN`, or `FAIL`.  
- Data Consistency Rules:  
  - Records where `SampleQC` is `NA` or `FAIL` must have `NaN` in the `NPX` column.  
  - Records where `SampleQC` is `PASS` or `WARN` must contain a real number (not `NaN`) in the `NPX` column.  
```

By following these validation rules, submissions will meet the required standards for data quality, enabling reproducibility and effective downstream analysis.

#### Olink Target series 

Olink Target Technology is a platform developed by Olink Proteomics that utilizes their proprietary Proximity Extension Assay (PEA) technology for targeted protein biomarker analysis. Unlike Olink Explore, which is designed for large-scale, high-throughput proteomics, Olink Target focuses on smaller, predefined panels tailored to specific biological pathways, disease areas, or research needs.

##### Olink Target data submissions

>[!IMPORTANT]
>NPX and Raw files are mandatory for each submission to ensure comprehensive and reproducible datasets. To minimize confusion and maintain consistency in categorizing Additional, Raw, and Results files, we strongly recommend adhering to the following naming conventions:
> 1. NPX files: Use the format 'file_name.npx.csv' for normalized protein expression files (e.g., NPX files). This ensures clarity in identifying processed data ready for downstream analysis.
> 2. Raw files (Ct): Use the format 'file_name.ct.csv' for files containing unprocessed, original data.

##### Raw File and Result validations for Olink Target 

- **NPX file**: From Olink Target is the key output file for analyzing protein expression levels after raw data has been processed and normalized. The NPX values are calculated to provide log2-transformed, normalized expression levels for proteins in each sample. The NPX file contains several columns, each providing essential data for downstream analysis. Here are the typical columns found in an NPX data file from Olink Target:

```
- Sample Information : Sample ID, Saple Plate, Sample Well, Group/Condition
- Protein Information : Protein Name, Protein ID, Olink Panel
- NPX Data : NPX Value, Below LOD (Limit of Detection), LOD (Limit of Detection)
- Quality Control (QC) Metrics - QC Flags, Replicate Consistency
- Control Information : Control Type, Control NPX
- Metadata (Optional) : Batch Id, Operator, Assay Plate, Experiment date
```

- **CT files**: Ct refer to the Cycle Threshold (CT) files, which contain raw data from the qPCR-based detection step in Olink assays. These files are crucial for understanding the initial fluorescence signal levels and are used in the normalization process to calculate the final Normalized Protein Expression (NPX) values. Here’s an overview of the CT files and their contents:

```
- Sample Information : 
  - Sample ID, Plate ID, Well Position
- Protein Information : 
  - Protein Name, Protein ID, Olink Panel
- Cycle Threshold (CT) Data : 
  - CT Value, Background CT
- Control Information : 
  - Control Type, Control CT Value
- Quality Control (QC) Metrics : 
  - QC Flags, Replicate Consistency
```

### SomaScan data submissions

@TODO: Move to the same format as Olink data submissions in tables. 

**.adat file**: For every SomaScan submission, the .adat file containing the 'RAW' reads, and protein quantification values without normalization MUST be provided. In addition, normalized versions of the .adat file can be included optionally. (We are still refining this part)

@TODO: Add more details about SomaScan data submissions


## Ownership, privacy and release of datasets to the public

This section is similar to [ProteomeXchange guidelines](https://www.proteomexchange.org/docs/guidelines_px.pdf) for MS-based proteomics submissions.

**Data Ownership**: Original submitters and Principal Investigators (PI) own the datasets submitted to PRIDE-AP resource. The submitter and PI must be explicitly identified for each dataset.

**Data availability after submission**: Submitted datasets are private (unreleased) by default, under password protection. Reviewers and editors can access data during the journal review process with the provided credentials.

**Changes to Datasets**: Changes to unreleased datasets are allowed upon request. However, after public release, changes must be justified and approved by PRIDE team.

**Public Release**: Public release of datasets is mandatory upon publication. Exceptions may be considered on a case-by-case basis. Pre-prints are not considered publications, allowing delayed release until formal acceptance.

**Withdrawal**: Unreleased datasets can be withdrawn before publication. Withdrawn entries are retained internally to prevent external access. Publicly released datasets can only be withdrawn in cases of retracted papers.

**Release Responsibility**: PX resources actively release datasets corresponding to known publications without submitters' permission. Authors should be aware that some journals may have similar release policies.

**Timely Release**: PX resources aim for prompt public release, but delays may occur due to production cycles and staff availability.

**Exceptions**: Exceptions to the public release policy may be granted in documented special cases, with a maximum 6-month extension for ongoing studies. Submitters must officially request an extension, considering journal requirements.

### Support for AP experiments in ProteomeXchange

At the time of writing, only MS-based experiments are supported by ProteomeXchange and ProteomeXchange PXD accession numbers are only released for MS-based experiments. Therefore, AP datasets stored in PRIDE will not be a part of ProteomeXchange, and the PRIDE database will independently release their accession numbers. ProteomeXchange may support AP data submissions in the future, but this is not the case at present.

## Conclusions

In conclusion, the PRIDE-AP serves as a pivotal platform dedicated to advancing the field of AP. By centralising datasets generated through cutting-edge technologies like Olink and SomaScan, PRIDE-AP aims to facilitate collaboration, accelerate research, and enhance the widespread dissemination of high-quality AP data. This document provides submission guidelines for datasets, emphasising the importance of adherence to PRIDE guidelines and policies.

The unique PAD accession identifier assigned to each dataset ensures proper citation in scientific literature. The document details the specific requirements for dataset structure and file formats, highlighting distinctions between SomaScan and Olink NGS-based data submissions. Additional files, experimental design, and metadata considerations are outlined to ensure comprehensive data representation. At the time of writing PRIDE-AP operates independently of ProteomeXchange for AP datasets and releases dataset accession numbers autonomously.
