## Introduction

This document provides comprehensive guidelines for submitting proteomics data to the PRIDE (PRoteomics IDEntifications) database, focusing on the supported file formats and specific requirements for different search engines and analysis tools. Following these guidelines will ensure your data is properly documented, can be effectively reused by the research community, and complies with journal data availability requirements.

## Overview of PRIDE Database

[PRIDE](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive) is a centralized repository for mass spectrometry-based proteomics data, including raw data, processed results, and associated metadata. It is part of the ProteomeXchange (PX) Consortium, which provides a coordinated submission process to proteomics repositories. PRIDE focuses on enabling data reuse, reproducibility, and transparency in proteomics research.

## PRIDE Submission Types and File Requirements

PRIDE supports two types of submissions: **PARTIAL** Submissions and **COMPLETE** Submissions. These categories are defined by the ProteomeXchange Consortium, of which PRIDE Archive is an active member. The main difference between the two submission types is that **COMPLETE** Submissions require standard file formats (such as mzIdentML or mzTab) for the results files, while **PARTIAL** Submissions primarily use tool-specific formats.

This document focuses on which file formats and extensions should be provided for **PARTIAL** PRIDE submissions, with **COMPLETE** submissions representing an extension of **PARTIAL** requirements. This document is coordinated between the PRIDE team and software producers and developers of computational proteomics tools to ensure their data is well represented in the archive.

**Note:** The term **PARTIAL** is a convention from ProteomeXchange and is not related to the quality or completeness of the dataset, but rather to the availability of results in a standard file format.

### File Requirements by Submission Type

| File Category | File Type/Format | PARTIAL Submission | COMPLETE Submission | Notes |
|--------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------|

| **OTHER** | Supplementary files (.pdf, .doc, .docx, figures, images, etc.) | Recommended | Recommended | Additional documentation, figures, and supplementary materials |

## Supported Raw Data Formats

In proteomics, RAW files are the proprietary data files generated by mass spectrometers, particularly from instruments made by Thermo Fisher Scientific (hence often referred to as Thermo RAW files).

### What RAW files contain:
RAW files store the raw, unprocessed mass spectrometry data, including:

 - MS1 spectra (precursor ions)

 - MS2 spectra (fragmented ions used for peptide identification)

 - Instrument settings (e.g., acquisition method, scan parameters)

 - Metadata (e.g., sample name, run time, calibration details)

### Why RAW files are important:

 - They are the starting point for downstream analysis, such as peptide/protein identification and quantification.

 - Tools like Proteome Discoverer, MaxQuant, and MSConvert (from ProteoWizard) are used to read or convert RAW files into open formats like mzML or mzXML for compatibility with a wider range of software tools.

### Common workflows:

 - **Acquisition** – Mass spectrometer generates a RAW file.
 - **Conversion (optional)** – RAW file converted to an open format (e.g., mzML, mzXML).
 - **Processing** – Peptide/protein identification and quantification using tools like MaxQuant, MS-GF+, OpenMS, etc.

Raw data files contain the unprocessed data directly from the mass spectrometer. PRIDE accepts the following formats:

| Format | Extension | Vendor/Source | Description |
|--------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Thermo RAW | .raw | Thermo Fisher Scientific | Binary format for Thermo instruments |
| Bruker BAF/TDF | .baf, .tdf | Bruker | Format for Bruker instruments |
| SCIEX WIFF | .wiff, .wiff2 | SCIEX | Format for SCIEX instruments |
| Agilent D | .d folder | Agilent | Format for Agilent instruments |
| Waters RAW | .raw | Waters | Format for Waters instruments |
| mzML | .mzml | PSI Standard | Open XML-based standard format |
| mzXML | .mzxml | ISB Standard | Legacy XML format |

## File Compression Strategies

Proper file compression is essential for efficient data storage and transmission when submitting to PRIDE. Below are recommended compression strategies for different file types:

### Raw Data Files

| File Type | Recommended Compression | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------------|-------|
| Thermo RAW | No compression (maintain as .raw) | These are already in a compressed binary format |
| Agilent .d folders | ZIP or TAR.GZ the entire folder | `tar -czf experiment1.d.tar.gz experiment1.d/` |
| Bruker .d folders | ZIP or TAR.GZ the entire folder | Include all subfolders and files |
| Waters RAW | No compression (maintain as .raw) | These are already in a compressed format |
| SCIEX WIFF | No compression (maintain as .wiff/.wiff2) | These are already efficiently stored |
| mzML/mzXML | GZ compression | `gzip large_file.mzML` to create `large_file.mzML.gz` |

**Important Notes for Raw Data:**
- When compressing directory-based raw data (.d folders), ensure you preserve the directory structure
- PRIDE accepts both uncompressed and compressed raw files
- For very large datasets, consider splitting into multiple compressed archives of reasonable size (< 50GB each)

### Search Results and Analysis Tool Outputs

| Tool | Recommended Compression | Strategy |
|------|-------------------------|----------|
| MaxQuant | ZIP or TAR.GZ the entire output folder | Group all txt files and the andromeda folder into a single archive named `maxquant_results.zip` |
| Mascot | ZIP multiple .dat files together | Group by experiment/project |
| DIA-NN | ZIP all TSV/CSV report files | Include all matrices and report files in one archive |
| Skyline | No compression for .sky/.skyd | These are already in a compressed format |
| FragPipe | ZIP all output directories | Group by experiment/search |
| TPP | ZIP all output XML files | Combine pepXML, protXML and other outputs |

**Example Commands:**
```bash
# Compressing a MaxQuant output directory
zip -r maxquant_results.zip ./maxquant/txt/

# Compressing multiple Mascot DAT files
zip mascot_results.zip *.dat

# Compressing DIA-NN outputs
zip diann_results.zip *.tsv *.csv report.*

# Compressing Agilent .d folder
tar -czf sample1.d.tar.gz ./sample1.d/
```

### mzIdentML and mzTab Files

- For large mzIdentML files: Use GZ compression (`gzip large_file.mzid`)
- For multiple mzTab files: Group and ZIP by experiment or analysis batch

### FASTA and Supplementary Files

- FASTA databases: Always compress with GZ (`gzip database.fasta`)
- Multiple supplementary files: Group logically and ZIP together

### General Compression Recommendations

1. **Group Related Files**: 
   - Group all results from a single analysis tool together
   - Use logical naming (e.g., `mascot_exp1.zip`, `maxquant_full_results.tar.gz`)

2. **Size Considerations**:
   - Try to keep individual compressed files under 50GB for easier upload
   - For very large datasets, split logically by experiment/fraction

3. **Documentation**: 
   - Include a README.txt file in each compressed archive explaining contents
   - Document the compression method used in your submission metadata

4. **Verification**:
   - Always verify the integrity of compressed archives before submission
   - Test extracting files from your archives to ensure they're correctly formed

5. **Directory Structure**:
   - Maintain a consistent directory structure across compressed files
   - Use relative paths within archives

**Note**: These guidelines are regularly updated to reflect new tools and formats. Please check the PRIDE website for the most current version of the submission guidelines.
